[KenKen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KenKen) or KenDoku puzzle game with JavaScript only.

Puzzle sites that provide KenKen (including the [official site](http://www.kenkenpuzzle.com/game))
runs with annoying ads and requires Flash, which sucks.
Even the smartphone app versions require credential information, which shouldn't
be really necessary for such simple puzzle game.

So I decided to create a very lightweight clone of the game entirely written by JavaScript.
